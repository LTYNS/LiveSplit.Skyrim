LiveSplit.Skyrim v1.4.2
=======================

LiveSplit.Skyrim is a [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) component for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

Features
--------
  * Keeps track of Game Time to get rid of loading times.
  * Auto start/stop/reset the timer.
  * Splits when you finish Helgen and default Alduin 2. (configurable)
  # Splits when you finish each guild. (configurable)

Install
-------
Starting with LiveSplit 1.4, you can download and install LiveSplit.Skyrim automatically from within the Splits Editor with just one click. Just type in "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" and click Activate. This downloads LiveSplit.Skyrim to the Components folder.

If the plugin is not working with this process, download the plugin from the [releases page](https://github.com/drtchops/LiveSplit.Skyrim/releases) and place the LiveSplit.Skyrim.dll in your Components directory of LiveSplit.

Configure
---------
Due to bugs in LiveSplit 1.4.0, it's recommended to deactivate LiveSplit.Skyrim in the Splits Editor after activating (downloading) it the first time. Instead, you should activate it in the Layout Editor, under the "Control" category. Double-click "Skyrim" after adding it to your layout to bring up the settings.

After configuring everything you'll most likely want to turn on game time as primary timing, so that your splits will run off game time. You can do this by right-clicking LiveSplit and going to Compare Against->Game Time.

#### Auto Split
The default settings are to automatically reset, start, and end the splits (the first and last splits). You can enable Helgen and guild autosplitting here.

#### Alternate Timing Method
This makes it show Real Time when comparing against Game Time, and vice versa. Doesn't work when LiveSplit.Skyrim is activated via the Splits Editor.
