automatically and automates splitting. It is based on Fatalis' component for
Dishonored.

    Frame-accurate load time removal.

    (Coming soon!) Automatic reset, start, and split. Automatic splitting can
    be done on mission end screens as well as at a few other common places.

Requirements:

    Skyrim (PC - latest)
    LiveSplit 1.4+

Install:

    Drop the LiveSplit.Skyrim.dll into LiveSplit's Components directory.

    (Soon: Enter "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" in LiveSplit's splits editor.
    Click activate.)
