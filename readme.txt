This is a LiveSplit (livesplit.org) component for Skyrim. It removes load times
automatically and automates splitting. It is based on Fatalis' component for
Dishonored.

Features:

    Frame-accurate load time removal.

    (Coming soon: Automatic reset, start, and split. Automatic splitting can
    be done on mission end screens as well as at a few other common places.)

Requirements:

    Skyrim (PC - latest)
    LiveSplit 1.4+

Install:

    Drop the LiveSplit.Skyrim.dll into LiveSplit's Components directory.
    Add Skyrim to your layout.
    Switch to the no loads timer by going to Compare Against -> Game Time.

    (Soon: Enter "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" in LiveSplit's splits editor.
    Click activate.)
